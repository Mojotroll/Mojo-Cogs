# Mojo-Cogs
This repo contains cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) designed by Twentysix26!
For any RedBot assitance, the Documents are located [Here](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/) or in the #support channel on the discord [server](https://discord.gg/red)
If you have questions or in need of assistance for my cogs, please contact me directly at mojotroll#6791
For current status on projects or future projects, you can find all of that on my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K4froUcU)

## Installing cogs

In order to install the cogs in this repo, run the following command: [p]cog repo add mojo-cogs https://github.com/Mojotroll/Mojo-Cogs

Secondly, I require library requirements for the following cogs:
*BBCF - Tabulate and Beautifulsoup4
*HoTS - Tabulate and Beautifulsoup4

Finally, Installing a cog you want is as easy using: [p]cog install mojo-cogs (Insert Cog name here)

## What is BBCF and how do I use it?

This cog is used for obtaining Frame data on the 36 playable characters in the game, Blazblue: Central Fiction, using the frame data provided from their wikis on [Dustloop](http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=BlazBlue:_Central_Fiction)!

How does it work?

*An example of a basic command ([p]am 5a) will retrieve the 5a information for Amane including movement properties provided in the box below the frame data and an image of the move.
*If you are starting out, learning anime fighters, or need to just learn Blazblue, I have added an option under the name 'TeachMeMissLitchi' that will provide you 'Intro to Fighting    Games', 'Intro to Anime Fighting Games', and 'Intro to BBCF' tutorial videoes for all skill levels.
*Additionally, Characters such as Litchi where she has moves that are only in staff and staffless stances have been broken down into a subcommand ([p]li e), I have provided all avaliable moves in the help menu for the character help menu, but can also be found using the command, [p]help li e. An example of the command would be ([p]li e 236a).

## What is HoTS and How do I use it?

DISCLAIMER:  This Cog is currently in its public alpha stage, this cog may change during the course of development!

This cog is used for obtaining Character info, trait, abilities, heroics, and Talents of Lv.1/4/7/(Not Level 10 as it is handled in Heroics)/13/16/20 (with the exception of chromie due to her trait) using the Wiki pages of each character on the [Gamepedia Wiki](https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Heroes_of_the_Storm_Wiki).

How does it work?

*A user can find information for each character using a command such as [p]artanis info
*A user can find trait for each character using a command such as [p]artanis trait
*A user can find abilities for each character using a command such as [p]artanis abilities
*A user can find heroics for each character using a command such as [p]artanis heroics
*A user can find Talents for each character using a command such as [p]artanis tlv((1/4/7/13/16/20)(1/2/5/11/14/18 for Chromie)

## What is Rage and How do I use it?

This cog is looks at chat and at any point, a user types 'rage' in chat, the bot will respond with [Rage](http://bensbargains.com/thecheckout/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nerd-rage.jpg).

How does it work?

*As long as the enpower command is on(This can only be turned on and off by users who have the 'manage role' permission), any time someone types (by itself) 'rage', the bot will display the image above!
