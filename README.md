# Mojo-Cogs
This repo contains cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) designed by Twentysix26!

For any RedBot assitance, the Documents are located [Here](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/) or in the #support channel on the discord [server](https://discord.gg/red).

If you have questions or in need of assistance for my cogs, please contact me directly at mojotroll#6791.

For current status on projects or future projects, you can find all of that on my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K4froUcU).

## Installing cogs

In order to install the cogs in this repo, run the following command: [p]cog repo add mojo-cogs https://github.com/Mojotroll/Mojo-Cogs

Secondly, I require library requirements for the following cogs:

*BBCF - Tabulate and Beautifulsoup4

*HoTS - Tabulate and Beautifulsoup4

Finally, Installing a cog you want is as easy using: [p]cog install mojo-cogs (Insert Cog name here)

## What is Captain Diomedes and How do I use it?

This cog is looks at chat and at any point, a user types 'captain diomedes' in chat, the bot will respond with a random quote assembled from the famous DoW II Captain Diomedes.

How does it work?

*As long as the enpower command is on(This can only be turned on and off by users who have the 'manage role' permission), any time someone types (by itself) 'captain diomedes', the bot will display the image above!
